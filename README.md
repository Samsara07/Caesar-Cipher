# Caesar-Cipher
These programs encrypt, decrypt, and crack any message using the Caesar Cipher.

# ENCRYPTION:
The user needs to type up their message and choose a number between 0-25 to shift the message. 

Example:

Input the text you want to encrypt: "Hello World!"
What you inputted: "Hello World!"
Input what you want your message to be shifted by: "5"

"Mjqqt Btwqi!"
 
 
# DECRYPTION:
The user needs to type up the encrypted message and type in the number originally used to shift the message.

Example: 

Input the text you want to decrypt: "Mjqqt Btwqi!"

Input what the original shift used to encrypt your message was: "5"

What you inputted: "5"

Here is the original Unshifted Word: "Hello World!"

 
# CRACKING:
The user needs to type up the encrypted message. 

Example: 

Input the text you want to decrypt:
